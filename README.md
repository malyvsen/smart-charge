# smart-charge
Smart Charge hackathon - efficient parallel computation of positioning of charging points for electric vehicles.
## Task one
We minimize the distance between nearest charging points in different cities.
For further optimization of solution, we take population & building density into account.
## Task two
We minimize the longest distance cars have to cover without recharging when traveling between cities.
